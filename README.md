# Climate Analysis

## Overview of Climate Analysis for June & December
The purpose of this analysis is to gain insight into temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round.

## Results
The climate analysis determined the following: 
### June Climate
- June in Oahu is 74°F on average. The lowest temperature for June is 63°F and the highest temperature is 87°F.

### Climate Comparison
- When comparing the temperatures of June and December, June's average temperature (74°F) is 3°F higher than December's average temperature (71°F). 
- The lowest temperature for December (56°F) is 7°F colder than the lowest temperature for June (63°F). Q1 for December's temperatures (69°F) also falls below 70°F. 
- The highest temperature for June (87°F) is 4°F warmer than the highest temperature for December (83°F). 

## Summary
Based on the analysis, a surf and ice cream shop may not be sustainable year round in Oahu. The temperatures during June would be well suited for a surf and ice cream shop, but the temperatures during December may be too cold to support a surf and ice cream shop with temperatures as low as 56°F. 

In order to better understand the climate in June and December, we have provided precipitation information for June and December. December (AVG 0.2) has higher precipitation rates on average than June (AVG 0.1). December's maximum precipitation (6.4) is also higher than June's maximum precipitation (4.0). Based on this additional analysis, we expect that a surf and ice cream shop would not be sustainable in December.
